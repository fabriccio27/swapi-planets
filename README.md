# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Motivation

This was similar to an exercise given in a technical assessment, to complete in an hour. The first commit is what I achieved in an hour. Still left to do are:
- Simple navigation to a details page when clicking on a card
- Infinite scroll

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
